- Unit tests []
	- For image and mask loading use example file and hard code expected results []
	- For fileMatcher create file structure of example directories and successfull directory can contain sample file []
- GUI []
	- Model []
	- View []
    - Have change listeners to the sliders and set the titles to show the value of the slider and it can also be an int input field []
    - Package title Label inside HBox with some regions beside/pad it so it is centered across the multiple grid columns [#]
    - Package CSV button inside HBox with some regions beside/pad it so it is centered across the multiple grid columns [#]
    - Package start button inside HBox with some regions beside/pad it so it is centered across the multiple grid columns [#]
    - Fix the sliders so that they are all always equally sized []
	- Controller []
    - For each of the button handlers for run type reset all the set paths etc []
    - Have thread safe (mutex protected) increment progress bar handler []
- Proper file matcher implementation []
- Probably more comprehensive commenting []
	- Fix up class documentation []
	- Remove the auto licencing code at the top of each class [#]
- Proper inheritance / override functions []
	- Classes which require toString, HashCode etc []
- Config file []
	- Implement loading and saving of config file []
		- Something so that the client can save file templates and things for common runs and just load those.
- UI []
	- Load and run single image []
		- Manually select Mask, Image Directory and CSV output file and run just for that
	- Run Single image []
		- Select single mask folder, and CSV out and program will auto locate Image directory and run
	- Run all images []
		- Runs for all mask files in a given folder. Auto find matching MRI's etc
- Speed and efficancy []
	- Implement threading for run all images mode []
		- Note the CSV writer class already uses mutexes to ensure writing rows is thread safe
	- Use a linear algebra library for Mask and Images []
		- Masking and counting / summing of voxels will be significantly faster. see: ND4J for possible library
- CSVWriter Class []
	- Add check for fileName/path ending in ".csv" if not there, add it automatically in init function []
